Try the demo at [https://pensive-elion-127e92.netlify.com](https://pensive-elion-127e92.netlify.com).

## Quick Setup

Install all of the application's dependencies:

`yarn install` or `npm install`

Next, you can start the application in a local environment with:

`yarn start` or `npm run start`

Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app running.

Otherwise, you can build the application into a `<rootDir>/build` directory with:

`yarn build` or `npm run build`

After that you can serve the optimized build at `http://localhost:8080` by default locally with:

`yarn serve` or `npm run serve`
